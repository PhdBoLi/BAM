# memristor based BAM Neural Network Implemented by Verilog-AMS 

## Overview
-----------------------------------------------
<!--project purpose--> 
This Project   
<!--;brief illustration of Verilog-AMS-->

<!--;brief illustration of Cadence virtuoso,spectre and AMS designer -->


## Dependency
-----------------------------------------------
Cadence Virtuoso Platform must be installed, the version is asked for IC617 or higher,coupled with the AMS designer installed. the detailed product ID for run Verilog-AMS is INCISIVE151 MMSIM151


## Sample Code Illustration of Verilog-AMS Design
-----------------------------------------------
### Voltage Source 


### passive Device instantiation 

### test pattern generation
For more details about Verilog-AMS language, please refer to "Cadence Verilog-AMS User Manual

## Geting Start
-----------------------------------------------
### Directory structure of the Verilog-AMS source file

### Set up spectre control file
;usage
The spectre control file is used to set up corresponding simulation option.

### Scalability
to change the scalability of the BAM neural network, you just simply change the related definition of macro, For example, in the top.vams file, you can change 24 to a large scale
